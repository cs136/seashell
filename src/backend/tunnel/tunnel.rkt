;; Launches an instance of the Seashell Tunnel backend.
;;
;; Configuration options (see config.rkt):
;;  host - host to connect to.
;;
;; Expects:
;;  seashell-tunnel should live in the same directory as this file.
;;
;; Arguments:
;;  user - User name.
;;  password - Password.
;;
;; Returns:
;;  A tunnel? structure, which contains the subprocess?,
;;  and the I/O ports required to communicate with the process.
;;  Standard error is read by the status thread and sent to the logger.
;;
;;  The tunnel either will have been set up OR an exception
;;  would have been raised at the end of this function.
;; 
;; Exceptions:
;;  exn:tunnel on tunnel error.
