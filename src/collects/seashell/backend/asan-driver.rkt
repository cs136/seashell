;; This driver lets you run the asan-error-parse.rkt file
;; directly (ie outside of seashell). This is faster for
;; development because you do not have to rebuild anything.
;; To use this file, edit asan-error-parse.rkt by commenting out
;; the (require ...) for seashell-config and run this driver directly
;; from the terminal with racket, for example:
;; shell> racket asan-driver.rkt /path/to/asan_output.txt | python -m json.tool
;;
;; This file has no other use and is not used by Seashell
;; backend.
